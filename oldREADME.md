#Postgres Oauth example
A demonstration of postgres oauth in node. Heavily follows [this guide](https://scotch.io/tutorials/easy-node-authentication-setup-and-local) from scotch.io, except I use postgres in place of Mongo for the database, and Jade in place of EJS for the html views.

## Server-side Setup
This app requires a basic postgres setup. It also requires a lot of private Oauth application setup from Facebook, Twitter, and Google involving developer access to their Oauth services. This involves filling in `config.js`.

1. Git clone
2. Make sure you have postgres set up with user `postgres` with password `postgres`. So create the user with that password. To use another user, change the knex connection config in the code.
4. `postgres` user should have createdb priviledges. To do so: `ALTER USER postgres createdb` in psql. 
5. Run the `psql_script.sql` script into postgres. Try using
    `psql -U postgres -a -f psql_script.sql`.
6. Rename `sample_config.js` to `config.js`.
7. Fill in `config.js` file with appropriate dev API access tokens. scotch.io has some [great guides](https://scotch.io/tutorials/easy-node-authentication-facebook) on how to do this.
